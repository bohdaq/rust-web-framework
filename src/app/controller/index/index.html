            <h1>Server is Up and Running</h1>
            <div>You see default page served by the server. You can change this page to whatever you need.
                Simply put <span class="accent">index.html</span> in your server's root folder.
            </div>
            <div>Whatever you put in the server folder will be accessible through the
                <a href="/" class="location accent">URL</a>
            </div>
            <div>If you put file bigger than there is available memory and then request it,
                server will be stopped with an error.
            </div>
            <div>These are default resources provided by the server:
                <span class="accent">favicon.svg, index.html, 404.html, script.js</span> and
                <span class="accent">style.css</span>.
                To override put corresponding files in the server's root folder.
            </div>
            <div>Security based restrictions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Website can not be used in iframe on other domains.</li>
                    <li>Resources will be sent to a user with a Content-Type based on file extension.
                        In practice this means if you, for example, create a js file named script.jstypo,
                        it won't be interpreted by a client's browser. Use correct file extensions.
